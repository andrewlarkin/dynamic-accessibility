        <p>Andrew Larkin, Master’s Candidate, Software Engineering, Department of Computing Sciences, Villanova University, Principal Investigator, has invited your participation in a research study.</p>

        <h2 class="da-h2">Study Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness in dynamically altering a website user interface based on the perceived ability of the user.</p>  

        <h2 class="da-h2">Description of the Research Study</h2>
        <p>If you decide to participate, then you will join a study being undertaken as a part of graduate research at Villanova University. You will be asked to perform four (4) tasks on a website over a two week period. You will only be asked to complete one task at a time and you will have 48 hours to complete each task. Each task should take no more than 10 minutes to complete. You may use your own device to access the internet and complete the tasks. However, you are asked to use the same device to complete each of the seven tasks and you will be asked to disclose what type of device you used to complete the tasks. Once the task is complete you will be asked to write a brief evaluation of your ability to complete the task. Tasks can be completed at your convenience, so long as they are completed within 48 hours of being issued. These tasks can be completed anywhere.</p>
